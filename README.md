# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Interconnect, a telecom provider. The company wants to proactively identify customers likely to leave and offer them retention incentives. The model is trained using personal, contractual, and service usage data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict churn probability for each customer based on their:
- Contract type
- Internet & phone services
- Payment method
- Tenure and other behavioral patterns

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The data is composed of four CSV files:

1. **contract.csv** – Contract type and duration
2. **personal.csv** – Personal customer data
3. **internet.csv** – Internet services used
4. **phone.csv** – Phone services used

All datasets are linked using `customerID`. The target column is:
- `EndDate`: if `No`, the customer stayed (label = 0), otherwise, churned (label = 1)

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Merge datasets using `customerID`
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features

2. **EDA & Feature Engineering**
   - Distribution of churn across services
   - Correlation between tenure, services, and churn

3. **Model Training**
   - Split into training/validation/test sets
   - Test multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Use AUC-ROC as the main metric

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Final model achieves **AUC-ROC ≥ 0.88**
   - Evaluate precision, recall, F1-score
